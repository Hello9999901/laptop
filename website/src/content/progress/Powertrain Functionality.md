Fixes need to be made on the second revision of the powertrain. Namely, a higher performance DC-DC converter and redesigning the ESP32-S3 setup.
Using a Teensy 4.1 to accelerate development times, all three chips have been verified to function as expected. Further testing needs to be conducted with charger IC.
