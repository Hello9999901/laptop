After ~0.5mm acetal delrin were installed underneath the keycaps and plates glued with cyanoacrylate adhesive (superglue), all the keycaps press and travel as expected. The delrin provides a softer and smoother bottom-out and just a tiny bit less travel. I can type on the keyboard normally, but the sizing and actuations require more typing to break-in.
